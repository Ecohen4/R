R
=

This repository contains general-purpose R scripts for data analysis and statistical analysis. 
Several of the examples are originally derived from an excellent, two-semester data analysis course at the University of Colorado Boulder taught by professor Balaji Rajagopalan. Professor Rajagoplan served as chair of my dissertation committee, and we co-authored a paper together on hierarchical linear models.  He deserves credit for introducing me to R, data analysis and visualization that have become the foundation of my work to this day.
This repository continues to grow as I conduct new research and collaborate with new colleagues at Columbia University, where I currently work as a Postdoc in mechanical engineering.
